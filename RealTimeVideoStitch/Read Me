What we are trying to do...

Access multiple camera streams at once.
Apply image stitching and panorama construction to the frames from these video streams.
Perform motion detection in the panorama image.

Project Structure:
|--- Realtime_video_stitching
|    |---- __init__.py
|    |--- basicmotiondetector.py
|    |--- panorama.py
|--- realtime_stitching.py

Run it with $ python realtime_stitching.py
Run it with $ python Filename.py

<FeaturePoint_SIFT.cpp>
<CMakeLists.txt>

What we are trying to do...

- Real-time feature points detection by SIFT (webcam)
- Feature points detection from file (video, image)
