# Configuration

A complete list of VR View parameters can be found in the table below.

Name | Type | Parameter description

`video` | String | URL to a 360째 video file or an adaptive streaming manifest file (.mpd or .m3u8). Exactly one of video or image is required.
`image` | String | URL to a 360째 image file. Exactly one of video or image is required.
`width` | String | String value for the iframe's width attribute.
`height` | String | String value for the iframe's height attribute.
`preview` | String | (Optional) URL to a preview image for a 360째 image file.
`is_stereo` | Boolean | (Optional) Indicates whether the content at the image or video URL is stereo or not.
`is_debug` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, turns on debug features like rendering hotspots ad showing the FPS meter.
`is_vr_off` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, disables the VR mode button.
`is_autopan_off` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, disables the autopan introduction on desktop.
`default_yaw` | Number | (Optional) Numeric angle in degrees of the initial heading for the 360째 content. By default, the camera points at the center of the underlying image.
`is_yaw_only` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, prevents roll and pitch. This is intended for stereo panoramas.
`loop` | Boolean | (Optional) When false, stops the loop in the video.
`hide_fullscreen_button` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, the fullscreen button contained inside the VR View iframe will be hidden. This parameter is useful if the user wants to use VR View's fullscreen workflow (via `vrView.setFullscreen()` callback) with an element outside the iframe. 
`volume` | Number | (Optional) The initial volume of the media; it ranges between 0 and 1; zero equals muted.
`muted` | Boolean | (Optional) When true, mutes the sound of the video.

# Building

This project uses `browserify` to manage dependencies and build. `watchify` is
especially convenient to preserve the write-and-reload model of development.
This package lives in the npm index.

Relevant commands:

$ npm install # install the npm

$ npm run build # builds the iframe embed and JS API (full and minified versions).
